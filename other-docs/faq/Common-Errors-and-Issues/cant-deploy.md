#  I click deploy, but nothing is happening 

If you're trying to initiate a deployment, but clicking deploy in the Altis Dashboard is not initiating a deploy, the deploy locks are still engaged.

First ensure another deployment wasn't initiated by another member of the team, or by the Altis Cloud auto-deploy bot. If no other deploy is in-progress, it's possible the deploy locks are stuck.

[Contact us](https://dashboard.altis-dxp.com/support/) so we can manually release deploy locks for you.
