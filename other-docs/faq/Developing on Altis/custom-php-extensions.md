# I want to implement a feature that requires a PHP Extension, can I install it?

No. It's not possible to customise the PHP extension configuration. 

We are not accepting requests for PHP Extensions, however, let us know that you're interested in a specific PHP extension. Tell us about your requirements and how you may use the extension. To request a feature, head on over to our roadmap, and submit your ideas - https://dashboard.altis-dxp.com/roadmap
