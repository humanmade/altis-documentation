#  Can I load Production or Non-Production upload assets directly in Local-server?

Yes, but isn't recommended.

While developing an Altis project in Altis Local Server, you maybe tempted to load upload assets from Production or Non-Production Altis Environments directly. This would save time, as you won't have to download assets locally. However, doing so is not recommended for most project. While technically possible, this requires advanced knowledge on NGINX and may cause undesired effects for your local environment.
