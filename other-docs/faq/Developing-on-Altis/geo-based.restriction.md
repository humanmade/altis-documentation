# Can I restrict access or content for specific countries? 

Altis supports geolocation targeting by default. You can make use of the `Cloudfront-Viewer-Country` HTTP Header to serve content on a per-country basis.

More granular regional data is not available via Altis, but third-party geolocation systems may be able to achieve this result instead. See: https://docs.altis-dxp.com/cloud/geo-targeting
