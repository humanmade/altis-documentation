#  Can I download logs from the Altis Dashboard?

Yes. It's possible to download CDN Access logs from the Altis Dashboard, but as yet no other log types are available for download.

If you need to download logs, find the environment you want logs for, and then click on the "Logs" sub menu item, followed by the "Access Logs" tab.

You can then select a date range and further filter the data, as well as choosing either CSV or JSON format.

## Example Filters

### Host name

To get logs for a specific host name choose the **"Host Header (x-host-header)"** field from the dropdown, and then enter the bare domain name as the value.

### URL Path

To filter by URL path choose the **"URI Path (cs-uri-stem)"** field from the dropdown, and then enter the full path including the leading and any trailing slashes as the value.
