# Can I download logs from the Altis Dashboard?

Partially. The only available logs to export and download are the CDN access logs. All other logs are not available for export. You can do this simply by heading to your Altis environment, in the menu for that environment, select 'Logs', then 'Access Logs'.

You can select the sample date you wish to download. Note that this will be a large amount of data, so we recommend starting with a small sample of less than 24 hours to get a sense of the amount of data you'd be working with.

If you need help downloading logs, or can't find what you're looking
for, [contact us](https://docs.altis-dxp.com/guides/getting-help-with-altis/) and we can assist you.

See our article on [logs and their retention periods](docs://cloud/dashboard/logs/) before requesting logs.
