# Quick start guide for the Altis CLI

The Altis CLI is a limited tool which allows you to interact with your Altis environments. Such as polling stack info, copy files to the Sandbox, quickly setup a local environment, and much more. An active Altis subscription is required to use the Altis CLI.

Follow up the setup readme here: https://github.com/humanmade/altis-cli

Once done, configure the cli tools with `altis-cli config setup`. If this returns `Saved configuration!`, the next time we run a command your browser will open a window to authorize the Altis CLI with your Altis Dashboard user. For example run `altis-cli stack info myenvironment-dev-01`; this will open a browser window, and follow the prompts.

This completes the setup, and you'll be able to run commands.

## Copying Files??

Copying files from your local computer to the Sandbox is fairly straightforward.
