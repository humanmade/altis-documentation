# Where is my data stored?

Your data is distributed among our technology stack. You can find information about the locality of each service as follows.

You can find information about [Database Servers (MySQL)](docs://cloud/database/) for
content, [S3 Storage](docs://cloud/s3-storage/) for assets, and [Backups](docs://cloud/backups/) in the documentation.

Information about your [Origin Location](docs://cloud/origin-locations/) can be found within the Altis Dashboard; at the top of
each environment's details pages, you can find the Region you're located within. All customer data is stored within this region, and
is stored in durable, persistent storage across multiple [availability zones](https://docs.altis-dxp.com/cloud/architecture/) (data
centres).

All your data is stored isolated from others, with fully dedicated infrastructure for each customer.
