# Welcome

Welcome to the HM Platform documentation. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to building sites on HM Platform.

HM Platform is designed in a modular way, and the documentation reflects this. Each module provides documentation on its configuration, features, and available internal APIs.

In addition, the [Getting Started documentation](docs://getting-started/) walks you through your first HM Platform project. This includes [project setup](docs://getting-started/), [configuring your project](docs://getting-started/configuration.md), and [building your own modules](docs://getting-started/custom-modules.md).

A [series of Guides](docs://guides/) is provided to guide you through specific tasks or types of projects. These guides walk you through the steps to achieve tasks.
