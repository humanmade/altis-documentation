# Welcome

![Welcome banner](./assets/banner-welcome.png)

Welcome to the Altis documentation. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to building sites on Altis.

Altis is designed in a modular way, and the documentation reflects this. Each module provides documentation on its configuration,
features, and available internal APIs.

## Getting Started

The [Getting Started documentation](getting-started/) walks you through your first Altis project. This
includes [project setup](getting-started/), [configuring your project](getting-started/configuration.md),
and [building your own modules](docs://core/custom-modules.md).

## Guides

A [series of Guides](guides/) is provided to guide you through specific tasks or types of projects. These guides walk you
through the steps to achieve tasks.

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from one version of Altis to another make sure to thoroughly read and follow the steps
in [the upgrading guides](guides/upgrading/).

## Releases

There is a [list of current and previous releases here](https://docs.altis-dxp.com/releases/), as well as more information
on [the Altis release process](guides/altis-releases.md) and the
accompanying [long term support policy](guides/long-term-support.md) in our guides.
