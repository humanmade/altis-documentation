# Welcome

![Welcome banner](./assets/banner-welcome.png)

Welcome to the Altis documentation. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to building sites on Altis.

Altis is designed in a modular way, and the documentation reflects this. Each module provides documentation on its configuration,
features, and available internal APIs.

## Altis in a Nutshell

Altis is a next-generation, enterprise-ready WordPress platform that raises the baseline for modern, large-scale projects.

What this means for you:

- Comes with batteries-included modules for things like authentication content modeling, search, and performance –
  all replaceable or extensible as needed.
- Provides a consistent development experience with unified tooling, environments, and documentation to keep teams productive and
  aligned.
- Lets you focus on building features, not re-implementing core enterprise needs like caching, identity, or deployment pipelines.
- Encourages flexibility with structure — custom code and third-party integrations are welcome, but follow clear conventions and
  QA standards.
- Built for scalability, security, and reliability from day one, with practices and tooling proven across enterprise deployments.

## Getting Started

The [Getting Started documentation](getting-started/) walks you through your first Altis project. This
includes [project setup](getting-started/), [configuring your project](getting-started/configuration.md),
and [building your own modules](docs://core/custom-modules.md).

## Guides

A [series of Guides](guides/) is provided to guide you through specific tasks or types of projects. These guides walk you
through the steps to achieve tasks.

## Upgrading
