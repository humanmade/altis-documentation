# Getting help with Altis.

If you need help, this guide will show you how to most effectively get you the help you need.

While we support a few methods, the primary method and the route you should choose, is the Altis Dashboard Support button.

We break down support into different types. Each has their own language and processes, but they're somewhat intuitive once you internalize the language a little. Let's go over the types.

We currently have four types of support. Below is a description of each and how they are different from each other.

# Incident

Incidents are unplanned events that negatively impact service, or quality of service of Altis. Be this part of the hosting infrastructure, or on the software side of Altis, if something isn’t getting the expected result, this would be an incident, and requires investigation.

From the support side, Incidents are the things that make us scamble to respond and jump on the problem. If the site is down, this is an Incident, with a prioriy of ‘Urgent’. Alarm bells will ring, and we’ll put out the fires to get things running again by any means neccessary.

Incidents focus on immediate attention, with an emphisis on immediate remediation. Remediating an Incident can take the form of temporary patches, which brings us to the next support type.

# Problem

Problems are the cause of, or potential cause of an Incidents. Incidents revolve around something the unexpected. If a site is down, that’s an Incident, but the Problem is a known cause of an issue you wish to track, and coordinate help with, problems typically take longer to resolve, as an appropriate solution is thoughtout, and worked on.

# Task 

There’s an array of tasks that might you need help with. Typically this might mean provisioning of infrastucture to accomodate some need. It might be providing access to some tool or service used by the team. Or run an operation that requires a cloud engineer. Tasks should be well described.

# Question (Service Requests)

This type is fairly self explanatory. Have a question for us? Ask!

If you need some kind of consultancy, technical question, clarification on a piece of the product, just open a support question.

# Other methods of support

I mentioned at the top of this page there was two main ways, and we’ve just covered the primary method. The second method is email, which is typically discouraged, but it’s useful to have thia ability when needed.

We have a few email addresses linked to our support, so we can ticket issues that come in, and they’re linked to different support types.

hosting@humanmade.com is the most commonly used, and this linked to an Incident type (non-urgent).

support@humanmade.com is rarely used, but this is linked to the Question support type.

sysops@humanmade.com is the linked to an ‘Urgent’ Incidident type, and is linked to PagerDuty, which alerts on-call engineers to the emergency.
