# How to submit a bug report.

Bugs happen, and weâ€™re here to support you. If you find a bug in Altis, we'll handle fixing it.

To help our product team understand your issue, there are some requirements for a bug report that must be met. This allows our team to know how to both identify the problem, and whether it has been resolved.

When [filing a bug report](./getting-help-with-altis.md) please provide all of the following:
## Test Results.

Please write a brief description of the bug, including what you expect to happen and what is currently happening.

## Reduced Test Case

Bugs should be isolated to a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/), as this helps us to ensure that the bug exists in Altis, rather than your project. Reduced test cases should be created against a standard Altis local environment with just the minimal changes needed to reproduce the bug.

Please ensure you provide the reduced test case as the basis of the bug report. If we cannot confirm that the test case is within Altis, we may ask you to reduce the test case further to ensure it isn't caused by your custom code.

Customers on Enterprise support plans may wish to use their dedicated technical engineering support to handle bug isolation.

## Steps to reproduce.

Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
## Environment Setup and Configuration.

Please let us know what environments the bug is occurring in, and whether you were able to reproduce the bug locally or not.
