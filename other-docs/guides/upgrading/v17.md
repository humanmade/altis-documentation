# Upgrading to v17

_If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out
the [migrating guide](../migrating/) first._

To upgrade to Altis v17, edit your `composer.json` and change the version
constraint for `altis/altis` and any local environment modules to `^17.0.0`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"altis/altis": "^17.0.0"
	},
	"require-dev": {
		"altis/local-server": "^17.0.0"
	},
	"config": {
		"platform": {
			"php": "8.1"
		}
	}
}
```

Once you have made these changes run `composer update` and then run
the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## Breaking Changes

### PHP 8.2 ###

Altis v17 continues our experimental support for PHP 8.2 in both local and cloud
environments. We have improved compatability with PHP 8.2 (and 8.1) but there
are a number
of [backward incompatible changes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration82.
incompatible.php) in PHP 8.2 which you should take into consideration.

Refer to our [PHP Version Guide](docs://guides/updating-php/) for up-to-date
compatibility, testing and upgrading information.

[TO DO] Mention updates to caching.
[TO DO] Add mention of updates to translations??

We created our own PHP extension just to optimise WordPress performance. Weâ€™ve
taken the slowest, most-used parts of WordPress, and reimplemented them to
squeeze every drop of performance out of your site.

To activate Afterburner on your
