# Upgrading to v14

_If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out the [migrating guide here](../migrating-from-wordpress.md) first._

To upgrade to Altis v14, edit your `composer.json` and change the version constraint for `altis/altis` and any local 
environment modules to `^14.0.0`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"altis/altis": "^14.0.0"
	},
	"require-dev": {
		"altis/local-server": "^14.0.0"
	},
	"config": {
		"platform": {
			"php": "8.0"
		}
	}
}
```

Once you have made these changes run `composer update` and then run the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## Breaking Changes

### Modules removed  ###

Altis v14 no longer includes the `johnbillion/extended-cpts` package. If your project requires it, you can include it by 
adding it as a dependency in your top-level `composer.json` file.

```sh
## Add Extended CPTs support
composer require johnbillion/extended-cpts
```
