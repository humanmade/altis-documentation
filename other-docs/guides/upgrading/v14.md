# Upgrading to v14

_If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out the [migrating guide here](../migrating-from-wordpress.md) first._

To upgrade to Altis v14, edit your `composer.json` and change the version constraint for `altis/altis` and any local 
environment modules to `^14.0.0`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"altis/altis": "^14.0.0"
	},
	"require-dev": {
		"altis/local-server": "^14.0.0"
	},
	"config": {
		"platform": {
			"php": "8.0"
		}
	}
}
```

Once you have made these changes run `composer update` and then run the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## Breaking Changes

### Modules removed  ###

#### Extended CPTs

Altis v14 no longer includes the `johnbillion/extended-cpts` package. If your
project requires it &mdash; if you are using `register_extended_post_type()`
or `register_extended_taxonomy()` &mdash; you can include it by
adding it as a dependency in your top-level `composer.json` file.

```sh
## Add Extended CPTs support
composer require johnbillion/extended-cpts
```

#### Workflows and Editorial Comments

Altis v14 no longer includes the workflows functionality. If you want to use
that functionality, you need to add the framework to your project.
In your top level project folder, add the `humanmade/workflows` framework
package

```sh
## Add Frameworks package
composer require "humanmade/workflows"
```

This provides the framework to create your own workflow functionality as well as
the "Editorial Comments" functionality.

#### Publication Checklist

The Publication Checklist feature has been removed from Altis v14. If you wish
to use that functionality you can add the `humanmade/publication-checklist` to
your project.

```sh
## Add publication checklist example
composer require "humanmade/publication-checklist"
```

This will provide you with the framework to write your own publication
checklist. If you want to use the previous Altis demo functionality as a
starting point, take a look at
the [Demo Github repository](https://github.com/humanmade/demo-publication-checklist)
