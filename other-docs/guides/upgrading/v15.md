# Upgrading to v15

_If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out
the [migrating guide](../migrating/) first._

To upgrade to Altis v15, edit your `composer.json` and change the version
constraint for `altis/altis` and any local
environment modules to `^15.0.0`.

```json
{
  "require": {
	"altis/altis": "^15.0.0"
  },
  "require-dev": {
	"altis/local-server": "^15.0.0"
  },
  "config": {
	"platform": {
	  "php": "8.0"
	}
  }
}
```

Once you have made these changes run `composer update` and then run
the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## Breaking Changes

### PHP 8.2 ###

Altis v15 introduces experimental support for PHP 8.2 in both local and cloud environments. There are a number of [backward incompatible changes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration82.incompatible.php) in PHP 8.2 which should be taken into consideration and addressed.

Refer to our [PHP Version Guide](docs://guides/updating-php/) for up-to-date compatibility, testing and upgrading information.

## Headline Features

### WordPress 6.2

WordPress 6.2 brings the Site Editor out of beta with an updated interface, giving you a new way to interact with the entire site. It also brings a new sidebar experience, a smoother experience with the Block Inserter and integration with Openverse's library catalogs. Also, writing-focused improvements will delight your content creators with the Distraction Free mode.
Additionally, several performance improvements are included with the latest WordPress release.

The [WordPress 6.2 Field Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/09/wordpress-6-2-field-guide/) is a great place
to learn about what's new. Here are some of the highlights:

- Site Editor out of beta
- There is a new server-side [HTML parsing API](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/07/introducing-the-html-api-in-wordpress-6-2/)
- Better PHP 8.0-8.2 compatibility with the updated Requests library
- Bundled fonts in Themes

### PHP 7.4 Security Support ###

As one of our top priorities, security is taken seriously in Altis. In Altis v13 the support for PHP 7.4 has been removed, and customers asked to follow the [PHP Version Guide](docs://guides/updating-php/) for information on how to upgrade to PHP 8.0 or PHP 8.1.

For the environments still running in PHP 7.4 we have released new PHP images which receive backports of security fixes from maintained branches. 


### Altis Core improvements 

A number of modules and libraries have been updated to incorporate important bug fixes and improvements.

### Documentation 

Some of our developer focussed documentation has been clarified and improved, taking on board feedback from our customers and partners.
