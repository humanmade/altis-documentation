#### Robots.txt Support

Altis no longer includes support for a custom robots.txt file. Instead you can
use WordPress' built-in support for robots.txt
If you previously had some custom rules in the file `.config/robots.txt` in the
root of your project, you can add those rules to
the standard robots.txt returned from WordPress by hooking in to
the `robots_txt` filter.

```php
add_filter( 'robots_txt', 'my_extra_robots_txt_rules', 10 );

/**
 * Add extra robots.txt rules.
 *
 * @param string $content robots.txt file content generated by WordPress.
 *
 * @return string robots.txt file content including custom configuration.
 */
function my_extra_robots_txt_rules( $content ) {

	return $content . <<<ROBOTS

User-agent: Googlebot 
Disallow: /example-sub-folder/

User-agent: * 
Disallow: *.rss$

Sitemap: https://your-domain.tlc/special-sitemap.xml

ROBOTS;
}
```

#### Sitemaps support

Altis no longer includes support for additional sitemaps functionality via the
Yoast SEO plugin. Instead you can use the built in functionality provided out of
the box by WordPress, which is enabled automatically. Additionally, several
off-the-shelf plugins (including Yoast SEO) provide functionality to enhance or
replace WordPress' functionality.

#### Yoast SEO Plugin

Altis no longer provides the Yoast SEO plugin. However you can install the
off-the-shelf plugin in your projects `composer.json` file.

```shell
## Add the Yoast SEO plugin
composer require "wppackagist/wordpress-seo"
```

If you are using the premium version of the plugin, follow
these [instructions on the Yoast website](https://yoast.com/help/how-to-install-yoast-plugins-using-composer/).
