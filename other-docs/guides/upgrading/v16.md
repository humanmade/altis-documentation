# Upgrading to v16

_If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out
the [migrating guide here](../migrating-from-wordpress.md) first._

To upgrade to Altis v16, edit your `composer.json` and change the version
constraint for `altis/altis` and any local
environment modules to `^16.0.0`.

```json
{
  "require": {
	"altis/altis": "^16.0.0"
  },
  "require-dev": {
	"altis/local-server": "^16.0.0"
  },
  "config": {
	"platform": {
	  "php": "8.0"
	}
  }
}
```

Once you have made these changes run `composer update` and then run
the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## Breaking Changes

### PHP 8.2 ###

Altis v16 have an experimental PHP 8.2 in both local and cloud environments. There are a number of [backward incompatible changes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration82.incompatible.php) in PHP 8.2 which should be taken into consideration and addressed.

Refer to our [PHP Version Guide](docs://guides/updating-php/) for up-to-date compatibility, testing and upgrading information.
