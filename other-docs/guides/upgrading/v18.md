# Upgrading to v18

_If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out
the [migrating guide](../migrating/) first._

To upgrade to Altis v18, edit your `composer.json` and change the version
constraint for `altis/altis` and any local environment modules to `^18.0.0`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"altis/altis": "^18.0.0"
	},
	"require-dev": {
		"altis/local-server": "^18.0.0"
	},
	"config": {
		"platform": {
			"php": "8.1"
		}
	}
}
```

Once you have made these changes, run `composer update` and then run
the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```
