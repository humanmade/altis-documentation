# Upgrading to v25

*If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out the [migrating guide](../migrating/) first.*

To upgrade to Altis v25, edit your `composer.json` and change the version constraint for `altis/altis` and any local environment
modules to `^25.0.0`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "altis/altis": "^25.0.0"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "altis/local-server": "^25.0.0"
    },
    "config": {
        "platform": {
            "php": "8.3"
        }
    }
}
```

Once you have made these changes, run `composer update` and then run the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## Headline Features

### Support for PHP 8.4

Altis v25 introduces support for PHP 8.4. It will first be available for testing in local server, then made available for upgrade
on development, staging and production environments.

#### Breaking changes:

- Deprecation of `php-v8js`: with the release of Altis v25, `php-v8js` is removed for PHP 8.4 and deprecated for earlier PHP
versions.

- All required dependencies have been updated to support the new version of PHP.

You might still see a couple of warnings here and there, but we are working on fixing them.

We have updated the default PHP version to 8.3.

### Altis Dashboard Features

#### Self-managed Allow list / Block list

You can now add individual IP addresses and ranges to allow lists to make sure they are never filtered,
Similarly, you can add IP addresses and ranges to block lists to stop those annoying offenders. Our automatic Web Application Firewall (WAF) still protects your sites out of the box,
these are additional manual controls on top of it.

#### Advanced traffic management 

We have implemented mechanisms for Bot control features. They will be rolled out in select environments first.
Contact your account manager if you are interested.

We have created a mechanism for shipping raw logs to client provided S3 buckets, giving you access to raw logs.
It is in pilot for select customers, it will soon be available for all.
Contact your account manager if you are interested.
