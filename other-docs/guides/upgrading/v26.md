# Upgrading to v26

*If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out the [migrating guide](../migrating/) first.*

To upgrade to Altis v26, edit your `composer.json` and change the version constraint for `altis/altis` and any local environment
modules to `^26.0.0`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "altis/altis": "^26.0.0"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "altis/local-server": "^26.0.0"
    },
    "config": {
        "platform": {
            "php": "8.3"
        }
    }
}
```

Once you have made these changes, run `composer update` and then run the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## WordPress 6.9

Altis adds support to WordPress 6.9, “Gene”, which brings collaboration-focused editor features plus meaningful frontend performance improvements:

- **Collaboration & workflow**: New **Notes** enable block-level commenting for reviews, and the **Command Palette** is expanded for faster navigation/actions across the dashboard.
- **Editor & blocks**: New **Fit text to container** typography option, improved drag-and-drop, and new blocks (including **Accordion**, **Time to Read**, and **Math**) to structure content.
- **Infrastructure/performance**: Major script/style loading optimizations (e.g. `fetchpriority`, footer script modules, on-demand block styles for classic themes, skipping assets for hidden blocks, larger inline CSS limit, and minified/inlined block-theme styles), plus **WP-Cron spawning at shutdown** to reduce impact on request time.
- **Platform compatibility**: **Beta support for PHP 8.5** (review runtime/CI and extension compatibility matrices).

For more details check the [WordPress 6.9 Field Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/11/25/wordpress-6-9-field-guide/)

## PHP

- PHP 8.3 is the default version and the minimum required version is PHP 8.2.

## Headline Features

- **Afterburner**: it has been upgraded to v1.0, which changes the architecture to move the object cache drop-in to user land PHP.

### Altis Dashboard Features

- Enabled IP management feature by default across all environments
- Added validation to prevent blocking IPs that are already on the allowlist
- Updated AI bot detection list with new bot identifiers
- Updated multiple composer dependencies to their latest versions

### Altis Local Server Improvements

- **Traefik** has been upgraded to **v3**, improving local server stability and ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of **Docker** and **Docker Desktop**. If you have added **custom Docker containers** to your local stack, you’ll need to update any **Traefik labels/annotations** in your add-ons to be compatible with Traefik v3. Refer to the Docker provider documentation for updated label formats and options of [Traefik for Docker](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/)
- **MySQL** has been upgraded to **v8.0.44** which is a maintenance release focused on fixes and incremental performance improvements, including updates across **InnoDB stability**, **query/optimizer correctness**, and **bundled OpenSSL refreshes on supported platforms**.
