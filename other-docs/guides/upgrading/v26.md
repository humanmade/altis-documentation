# Upgrading to v26

*If you are migrating from WordPress to Altis, check out the [migrating guide](../migrating/) first.*

To upgrade to Altis v26, edit your `composer.json` and change the version constraint for `altis/altis` and any local environment
modules to `^26.0.0`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "altis/altis": "^26.0.0"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "altis/local-server": "^26.0.0"
    },
    "config": {
        "platform": {
            "php": "8.3"
        }
    }
}
```

Once you have made these changes, run `composer update` and then run the `wp altis migrate` command:

```sh
# For cloud environments
wp altis migrate

# For local server
composer server cli -- altis migrate
```

## WordPress 6.9

Altis adds support to WordPress 6.9, “Gene”, which brings collaboration-focused editor features plus meaningful frontend performance improvements:

- **Collaboration & workflow**: New **Notes** enable block-level commenting for reviews, and the **Command Palette** is expanded for faster navigation/actions across the dashboard.
- **Editor & blocks**: New **Fit text to container** typography option, improved drag-and-drop, and new blocks (including **Accordion**, **Time to Read**, and **Math**) to structure content.
- **Infrastructure/performance**: Major script/style loading optimizations (e.g. `fetchpriority`, footer script modules, on-demand block styles for classic themes, skipping assets for hidden blocks, larger inline CSS limit, and minified/inlined block-theme styles), plus **WP-Cron spawning at shutdown** to reduce impact on request time.
- **Platform compatibility**: **Beta support for PHP 8.5** (review runtime/CI and extension compatibility matrices).
