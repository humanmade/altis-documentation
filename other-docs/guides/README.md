Altis Guides are here to help you with meta issues and larger tasks that don't fit in to any specific module. Here you can find help with [how to upgrade](./upgrading/README.md), [how to migrate to Altis](./migrating-from-wordpress.md), [how to use Altis as a headless CMS](./headless/), [how to automate updates](./automatic-updates.md) and more.
