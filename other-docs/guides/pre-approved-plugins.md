# Pre-Approved Plugins

There is a wealth of 3rd party plugins that add complex features to Altis from events management to ecommerce.

Typically all 3rd party code should be reviewed and approved by a software engineer on your team before it is deployed to ensure that your application running on Altis stays fast and secure. [You can read more about how to add 3rd party plugins to your application here](docs://getting-started/third-party-plugins.md).

To help reduce the overhead for delivery teams we keep a list of trusted plugins produced and maintained by industry leaders that you can refer to. These plugins do not require an in-depth review prior to installing.

**Note:** Pre-approved plugins should only be viewed as recommendations and are not directly supported by Altis.
