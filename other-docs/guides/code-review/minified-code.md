# Minified / Obfuscated Code

All PHP and JavaScript code needs to be provided in unminified format in a way the reviewer is able to read. In situations where minified code is committed to the git repository for code review, the unminified source should also be provided with a description of how to reproduce the minified version.

In situations where JavaScript code may need to be obfuscated, it's recommended to perform the obfuscation at run-time on the server to have full source code transparency.

Generally, minified code is generated by build tools such as Webpack or Grunt. These built files shouldn't be committed to your repository, and can easily cause merge conflicts. Rather than committing built code, use [build scripts](docs://cloud/build-scripts.md) to compile your code during the build and deploy process.
