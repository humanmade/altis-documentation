# Creating content in Altis with blocks

## What are blocks?

Blocks are the **components for adding content** in Altis. Each block can contain a distinct part of the content on your page. A block can be a paragraph of text, images, videos galleries, plus lots more. You can **drag** and **rearrange** blocks, and be as flexible as you need to be with your layouts. 

Your readers won’t see the blocks–they just see your beautiful content. Check out this [list of common blocks](https://wordpress.org/support/category/common-blocks/) you can use.

## Block sidebar

The block sidebar where you can edit the Block’s **settings**.

Click the block you want to edit. If you don’t click on the block first, you’ll see this:

As you can see, the paragraph block offers text settings, colour settings, and **advanced options**.
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image10.png)

### Text settings

Here’s where you can change the paragraph’s **font size**, either with relative percentages or exact pixels. 

### Colour settings

You can set text and background colours on a per-block basis, enabling you to **call attention** to important content.

By clicking on the chequered area, you can **choose specific colours**. You can click the hue in the big box or move the sliders:

 You can also click the slider icon to choose Hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL:

**Accessibility checks** are also built into the new editor. You’ll get a warning if any text colour combinations could cause problems for people with reading impairments.

Advanced

Click the advanced tab to add a custom CSS class. It can then pick up styles for your block from [custom CSS](https://wordpress.com/support/editing-css/) you create:

![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image37.png)

## How to edit content in a block

### How to align text in a block

Click the **align icon** to align everything inside the block, left, centre or right:
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image6.png)

### How to make text bold

Highlight some text and then click the **bold icon** (or use CMD+B/CTRL+B):
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image16.png)

### How to make text italic

Highlight some text and then click the **italic icon** (or CMD+I/CTRL+I):
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image31.png)

### How to add hyperlinks

![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image25.png)

Start typing the page name or enter the URL (make sure to include https://):
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image40.png)

You then have three hyperlinking options:
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image39.png)

Toggle to:
- **Open in new tab**
    Toggle this when you want the clicked page to open in a new tab. Normally this is bad practice (because users can’t click the back button in the new tab), However, it can be useful when hyperlinking to a pdf document, online tool, or somewhere else that isn’t another website page. 
- **Tell search engines to ignore the link**
    Toggle this when you don’t want search engines crawling the hyperlink and boosting the link’s SEO ranking. Maybe because you’re linking as part of a sponsored deal, or it’s a page you don’t trust.
- **Tell search engines this is a sponsored link or advert**
    Toggle when you want search engines to know the hyperlink is paid for or incentivised.

### How to insert images and format text into a block

    Make selected text appear like a computer code snippet. Often in a fixed pitch font (each character occupies the same amount of space. The word "$example" below:
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image1.png)
- **Inline image**

#### How to edit a block’s html

#### How to reuse a block you created

Maybe you find yourself often creating a layout with the same blocks. For example, a page with blocks for:

![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image19.png)

You can save this as a template that can be reused. View [Reusable blocks](reusable-blocks.md) to see how.

As you select multiple blocks, the **Block sidebar** keeps track for you:
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image2.png)

You can now make edits in the sidebar which will apply to all selected blocks. The image below shows the blocks after modifying the font size and letter spacing:
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image26.png)
Depending on the blocks you select, you may also be able to **transform** the blocks into a different type. Select the **block icon** on the left of the block toolbar (here it is a pragraph icon).

![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image47.png)
For example, multiple paragraphs transformed into a bulleted list:
![](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image48.png)

Click the block you want to delete. Then click **Options > Remove block** where "block" will be the type of the block.
