# Creating content in Altis with blocks

## What are blocks?

Blocks are the **components for adding content** in Altis. Each block can contain a distinct part of the content on your page. A
block can be a paragraph of text, images, videos galleries, plus lots more. You can **drag** and **rearrange** blocks, and be as
flexible as you need to be with your layouts.

Your readers won’t see the blocks–they just see your beautiful content. Check out
this [list of common blocks](https://wordpress.org/support/category/common-blocks/) you can use.

## Block sidebar

The block sidebar where you can edit the Block’s **settings**.

Click the block you want to edit. If you don’t click on the block first, you’ll see this:

As you can see, the paragraph block offers text settings, color settings, and **advanced options**.

### Text settings

Here’s where you can change the paragraph’s **font size**, either with relative percentages or exact pixels.

### Color settings

You can set text and background colors on a per-block basis, enabling you to **call attention** to important content.

By clicking on the chequered area, you can **choose specific colors**. You can click the hue in the big box or move the sliders:

You can also click the slider icon to choose Hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL:

**Accessibility checks** are also built into the new editor. You’ll get a warning if any text color combinations could cause
problems for people with reading impairments.

from [custom CSS](https://wordpress.com/support/editing-css/) you create:

You then have three hyperlinking options:

![Screenshot](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image39.png)

Toggle to:

- **Open in new tab**
  Toggle this when you want the clicked page to open in a new tab. Normally this is bad practice (because users can’t click the back
  button in the new tab), However, it can be useful when hyperlinking to a PDF document, online tool, or somewhere else that
  isn’t another website page.- **Tell search engines to ignore the link**
  Toggle this when you don’t want search engines crawling the hyperlink and boosting the link’s SEO ranking.
  Maybe because you’re linking as part of a sponsored deal, or it’s a page you don’t trust.
- **Tell search engines this is a sponsored link or advert**
  Toggle when you want search engines to know the hyperlink is paid for or incentivized.

  space. The word "$example" below:

#### How to edit a block’s HTML

font size and letter spacing:

![Screenshot](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image26.png)

Depending on the blocks you select, you may also be able to **transform** the blocks into a different type. Select the **block icon
** on the left of the block toolbar (here it is a paragraph icon).

![Screenshot](../assets/creating-with-blocks-image47.png)
